#There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively. 
#
# Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)). 
#
# You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty. 
#
# Example 1: 
#
# 
#nums1 = [1, 3]
#nums2 = [2]
#
#The median is 2.0
# 
#
# Example 2: 
#
# 
#nums1 = [1, 2]
#nums2 = [3, 4]
#
#The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
